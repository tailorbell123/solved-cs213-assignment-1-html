In the homepage see that, you have used the following features:

(a) image, (b) table,

(c) a link to some other website, (d) different sizes of text,

(e) paragraph(f) at least one text alignment like center.

(g) colored text (h) list,

(i) heading, (j) title.

What we are looking for is basic html page, and not javascript here.
